# queueapp

utilising php, mysql, jquery and bootstrap.
adding customers to the queue is instant and kept in a neat and responsive design.
the logo concept is based on moving 'up' the queue :)

requirements are editing the dbh.php to connect to the database.
please see sql.sql for table structure.

further this app could be expanded to add a 'clear all' on the queue list.
also adding a feature for an admin login and options to edit/add types and services could be helpful to create more freedom and adaptability to changes in user requirements at a later stage.
